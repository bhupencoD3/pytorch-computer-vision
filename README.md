### 13. **Custom DataLoader**

*Notebook:* `concept_custom_data_loader/custom_data_loader.ipynb`

* Built a custom Dataset class by subclassing `torch.utils.data.Dataset`.
* Implemented `__init__`, `__len__`, `__getitem__` for preprocessing.
* Wrapped in `DataLoader` for batching, shuffling, parallel loading.
* Trained model with batching and epoch updates.

**Outcome:** Designed flexible and reusable data pipelines in PyTorch.

### 14. **Custom Image Dataset Loader**

*Notebook:* `custom_image_dataset_loader/image_dataset_loader.ipynb`

* Implemented an image dataset loader using PyTorch `Dataset` and `DataLoader`.
* Loaded images from directory structure (`train/`, `test/`).
* Applied transforms (`Resize`, `ToTensor`).
* Created mappings for class names and labels.
* Visualized images using Matplotlib after loading.

**Outcome:** Gained experience in handling image datasets for classification tasks.

### 15. **CNN Training on Custom Dataset**

*Notebook:* `CNN_training/cnn_training_custom_dataset.ipynb`
